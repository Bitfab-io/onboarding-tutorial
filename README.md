# Bitfab's onboarding tutorial, 3D printing workflow basics


## Skills

* Basic git workflow with Github Desktop
* Basic 3D modelling with FreeCAD
* 3D printing slicing
* 3D printing
* Markdown


## Prerequisites


### Accounts

* Github account.
	* Add user to Bitfab team
* Slack
	* Add user to Bitfab community


### Installed software

* Github Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
* FreeCAD: https://www.freecadweb.org/
* Cura: https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software
* Text editor, for example, Sublime text: https://www.sublimetext.com/
* Slack mobile app and/or desktop app: https://slack.com/


## Tutorial

### Creating a new Github issue

* Create a new issue asking for the new tool holder
* Assign it to the operator in training
* A new message will appear in Slack with the new issue (not instantly)
* Clarification: Github issues are not always going to be the entry point of new tasks or jobs, but we need to know how to create one because they are part of the workflow at Bitfab.

### Cloning the repository with Github Desktop

* Go to https://github.com/Bitfab-io/onboarding-tutorial
* Clone repository with Github Desktop
	* Suggested paths: `user/repos/onboarding-tutorial`, `user/repos/Bitfab/onboarding-tutorial`
* Open local repository

### Designing a new tool holder with FreeCAD

* Exporting an STL file
* Technical drawings
* Exploded views or assemblies?

### Pushing changes to Github


### Slicing

#### Most important slicing parameters

* **Noozle diameter**
	* Choose the nozzle diameter that is installed in the printer.
	* Higher nozzle diameters give faster printing times but lower print quality in the XY plane.
	* Typical values: 0.4mm or 0.8mm nozzles.
* **Layer height**
	* Higher layer heights give faster printing time but lower print quality in the Z axis.
	* Typical values: 0.2mm is the most used value, 0.1 or 0.3mm can also be used.
* **Speed**
	* Higher speeds give faster printing times but lower print quality.
	* Typical values: Between 30 and 60mm/s
* **Temperatures**
* **Retraction**


### Documenting the print

* Markdown
* Photo of the print

### Closing the issue

* Close the Github issue
